    <h7>Synopsis
        Main article: List of Jujutsu Kaisen characters
        Setting
        In Jujutsu Kaisen, all living beings emanate an energy called Cursed Energy,
        [Jp. 1] which arises from negative emotions that naturally flow throughout the body. 
        Normal people cannot control this flow in their bodies. As a result, they continually 
        lose Cursed Energy, resulting in the birth of Curses,[Jp. 2] a race of spiritual beings 
        whose primary desire is to bring harm to humanity. These curses are shown as gruesome 
        monsters.Jujutsu Sorcerers[Jp. 3] are people who control the flow of Cursed Energy in their 
        bodies, allowing them to use it as they please and also to reduce its release. High-ranking 
        Sorcerers and Curses can refine this energy and use it to perform Cursed Techniques,[Jp. 4] 
        which tend to be unique to the user or their family. An advanced form of Cursed Technique is 
        Domain Expansion,[Jp. 5]through which the user can use their Cursed Energy to build a pocket 
        dimension that covers the surrounding area within which all attacks will be stronger.
